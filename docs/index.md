# Orion Talk documentation

Orion Talk is a small message service for those who want to add chat features
in a system.

Orion Talk is written in [Java/Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) through [reactive
programming](https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-reactive) and prepared to
run with [native compilation](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image),
in other words, it is a code developed to run in cloud services with high
availability, low memory consumption (high density in clusters) and low
throughput.
