## ▶️ Getting started

First of all, Thank you so much for purchasing this template and for being our loyal customer. You are awesome! You are entitled to get free lifetime updates to this product and support from the cssninjaStudio team directly. **Moebius** is a product built by [cssninjaStudio](https://cssninja.io/) and [Digisquad](https://digisquad.io/).

### Prerequisites

1. A recent web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, ...)
2. [Nodejs LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) _(> 14.x with npm >7)_ installed
3. Knowledge with [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript) _(> 4.x)_ (should not be installed globally)
4. (recommended) [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/ with [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar)

#### Install nodejs

1. Check if you already have Node.js installed. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

If node is not installed on your machine, you can go to the official nodejs.org website, and choose the version depending on your operating system:

- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Install node.js and npm on Windows, Linux or Mac OSX</a>

2. Enable pnpm with corepack

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

> _corepack is installed with node from **v16.13.x**, if your version is below, install it with: `npm install -g corepack`_

To setup the template and start installing project dependencies, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install
```

Note that you can also use other package manager (npm or yarn) but we recommend using pnpm:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# using yarn
yarn install
```

## 🔃 Run a development server

To start the development server, run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will run the `dev` script from the `package.json` file.

Vite is the build tool that we use to compile the frontend code.
It replace webpack and vue-cli, used in vue 2 ecosystem.
